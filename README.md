ClickTrack
----------

This project uses a fork of a project by Michael Nye. Entitled ClickTrack, it
is also [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/thenyeguy/ClickTrack). The project
is an audio processing framework written C++, and is used as the backend of this
project, by integrating with the Android NDK.

Since this project has been developed for some time, it is important for the
project to track what has been developed specifically as part of this final
project, versus what code was already written. So far, that list is:

1. Numerous code refactors
2. PolyBLEP oscillators
